# nvblox Experiments Folder
Often in the early stages of developing a new feature for nvblox, it is useful to have a space to try things out *in the source tree* but not mixed with the library code. This folder is a space to do that in. Simply create a new executable, or modify `test_bench.cpp` and try things out.
