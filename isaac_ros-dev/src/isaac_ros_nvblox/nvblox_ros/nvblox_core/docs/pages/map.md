# Map Overview
We implement a hierarchical sparse voxel grid for storing data. At the top level we have the ``LayerCake``, which contains several layers, each of which contains a different type of mapped quantity (eg TSDF and ESDF). A layer is a collection of sparsely allocated blocks. Each block is in charge of mapping a cubular small region of space. Most blocks are composed of many voxels, each of which captures a single value of the mapped quantity (eg the TSDF).

The API for the various classes implementing a map nvblox map:

## Voxels

* [TsdfVoxel](@ref nvblox::TsdfVoxel)
* [EsdfVoxel](@ref nvblox::EsdfVoxel)
* [ColorVoxel](@ref nvblox::ColorVoxel)
* [OccupancyVoxel](@ref nvblox::OccupancyVoxel)
* [FreespaceVoxel](@ref nvblox::FreespaceVoxel)

## Blocks

A template for a block containing voxels.

* [VoxelBlock](@ref nvblox::VoxelBlock)

Blocks containing specific voxel types. These are just typedefs of the above voxel blocks.

* [TsdfBlock](@ref nvblox::TsdfBlock)
* [Esdflock](@ref nvblox::TsdfBlock)
* [ColorBlock](@ref nvblox::TsdfBlock)
* [OccupancyBlock](@ref nvblox::OccupancyBlock)
* [FreespaceBlock](@ref nvblox::FreespaceBlock)

We store the mesh of the environment as a collection of smaller meshes. In particular, a ``MeshLayer`` contains ``MeshBlocks``, each of which contains a mesh of the surfaces in that region contained within that block. Note that we store a mesh per *block*, there are no mesh *voxels*.
Storage of the mesh in this way allows us to perform incremental updates (we only update the mesh in blocks where the underlying TSDF has changed).

* [MeshBlock](@ref nvblox::MeshBlock>)

## Layers

Template classes for layers containing blocks, and the child class for layers containing ``VoxelBlock`` s.

* [BlockLayer](@ref nvblox::BlockLayer)
* [VoxelBlockLayer](@ref nvblox::VoxelBlockLayer)

Typedefs for layers containing specific block types and voxel block types.

* [TsdfLayer](@ref nvblox::TsdfLayer)
* [EsdfLayer](@ref nvblox::EsdfLayer)
* [ColorLayer](@ref nvblox::ColorLayer)
* [OccupancyLayer](@ref nvblox::OccupancyLayer)
* [FreespaceLayer](@ref nvblox::FreespaceLayer)

## Layer Cake

The ``LayerCake`` combines several layers into a single object. 

* [LayerCake](@ref nvblox::LayerCake)
